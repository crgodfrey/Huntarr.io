## Overview

This application continually searches your media libraries for missing content and items that need quality upgrades. It automatically triggers searches for both missing items and those below your quality cutoff. It's designed to run continuously while being gentle on your indexers, helping you gradually complete your media collection with the best available quality.

## Why You Need Huntarr

Think of it this way: Sonarr/Radarr are like having a mailman who only delivers new mail as it arrives, but never goes back to get mail that was missed or wasn't available when they first checked. Huntarr is like having someone systematically go through your entire wishlist and actually hunt down all the missing pieces.

Here's the key thing most people don't understand: Your *arr apps only monitor RSS feeds for NEW releases. They don't go back and search for the missing episodes/movies already in your library. This means if you have shows you added after they finished airing, episodes that failed to download initially, or content that wasn't available on your indexers when you first added it, your *arr apps will just ignore them forever.

Huntarr solves this by continuously scanning your entire library, finding all the missing content, and systematically searching for it in small batches that won't overwhelm your indexers or get you banned. It's the difference between having a "mostly complete" library and actually having everything you want.

Most people don't even realize they have missing content because their *arr setup "looks" like it's working perfectly - it's grabbing new releases just fine. But Huntarr will show you exactly how much you're actually missing, and then go get it all for you automatically.

Without Huntarr, you're basically running incomplete automation. You're only getting new stuff as it releases, but missing out on completing existing series, filling gaps in movie collections, and getting quality upgrades when they become available. It's the tool that actually completes your media automation setup.

## How It Works

### 🔄 Continuous Automation Cycle

#### 1️⃣ Connect & Analyze
🔌 Huntarr connects to your Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Readarr/Whisparr/Eros instances and analyzes your media libraries to identify both missing content and potential quality upgrades.

#### 2️⃣ Hunt Missing Content
- 🔍 **Efficient Refreshing:** Skip metadata refresh to reduce disk I/O and database load
- 🔮 **Future-Aware:** Automatically skip content with future release dates
- 🎯 **Precise Control:** Configure exactly how many items to process per cycle
- 👀 **Monitored Only:** Focus only on content you've marked as monitored

#### 3️⃣ Hunt Quality Upgrades
- ⬆️ **Quality Improvement:** Find content below your quality cutoff settings
- 📦 **Batch Processing:** Set specific numbers of upgrades to process per cycle
- 🚦 **Queue Management:** Automatically pauses when download queue exceeds your threshold
- ⏱️ **Command Monitoring:** Waits for commands to complete with consistent timeouts

#### 4️⃣ API Management
- 🛡️ **Rate Protection:** Hourly caps prevent overloading your indexers
- ⏲️ **Universal Timeouts:** Consistent API timeouts (120s) across all applications
- 🔄 **Consistent Headers:** Identifies as Huntarr to all Arr applications
- 📊 **Intelligent Monitoring:** Visual indicators show API usage limits

#### 5️⃣ Repeat & Rest
💤 Huntarr waits for your configured interval (adjustable in settings) before starting the next cycle, ensuring your indexers aren't overloaded while maintaining continuous improvement of your library.

## Web Interface

Huntarr's live homepage will provide you statics about how many hunts have been pursed regarding missing media and upgrade searches! Note: Numbers reflected are but all required for testing.

  <img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c060962c-01ee-4f53-a5ee-c67f31432e40" />
  <br>
  <em>Homepage</em>
</p>

Huntarr includes a real-time log viewer and settings management web interface that allows you to monitor and configure its operation directly from your browser.

  <br>
  <em>Logger UI</em>
</p>

### How to Access

The web interface is available on port 9705. Simply navigate to:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:9705
```

The URL will be displayed in the logs when Huntarr starts, using the same hostname you configured for your API_URL.

### Web UI Settings

The web interface allows you to configure all of Huntarr's settings:

  <br>
  <em>Settings UI</em>
</p>

### Volume Mapping

To ensure data persistence, make sure you map the `/config` directory to a persistent volume on your host system:

```bash
-v /your-path/appdata/huntarr:/config
```

## The Perfect Pair: Huntarr & Cleanuperr

**Huntarr** is the compulsive librarian who finds missing media and upgrades your existing content. It fills in the blanks and improves what you already have.

**Cleanuperr** ([![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/flmorg/cleanuperr?style=social)](https://github.com/flmorg/cleanuperr/stargazers)) is the janitor of your server; it keeps your download queue spotless, removes clutter, and blocks malicious files.

When combined, these tools create a powerful, self-sufficient media automation stack:

- **Huntarr** hunts for content to add to your library
- **Cleanuperr** ensures only clean downloads get through
- Together, they create a reliable, hands-off media management system

## Tips

- **First-Time Setup**: Navigate to the web interface after installation to create your admin account with 2FA option
- **API Connections**: Configure connections to your *Arr applications through the dedicated settings pages
- **Search Frequency**: Adjust Sleep Duration (default: 900 seconds) based on your indexer's rate limits
- **Batch Processing**: Set Hunt Missing and Upgrade values to control how many items are processed per cycle
- **Queue Management**: Use Minimum Download Queue Size to pause searching when downloads are backed up
- **Skip Processing**: Enable Skip Series/Movie/Artist Refresh to significantly reduce disk I/O and database load
- **Future Content**: Keep Skip Future Items enabled to avoid searching for unreleased content
- **Authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication for additional security on your Huntarr instance
- **API Rate Limits**: Configure hourly API caps to prevent rate limiting by your indexers
- **Universal Timeouts**: All apps use consistent 120s timeouts for reliable command completion
- **Monitored Only**: Filter searches to focus only on content you've marked as monitored
- **Notifications**: Configure Apprise notifications to get alerts when media is processed

## Troubleshooting

- **API Connection Issues**: Verify your API key and URL in the Settings page (check for missing http:// or https://)
- **Config URLs**: It is best practice to omit the trailing slash (/) at the end of the URL for each service. For Sonarr, use http://10.10.10.1:8989 instead of http://10.10.10.1:8989/
- **Authentication Problems**: If you forget your password, delete `/config/user/credentials.json` and restart
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: If locked out of 2FA, remove credentials file to reset your account
- **Web Interface Not Loading**: Confirm port 9705 is correctly mapped and not blocked by firewalls
- **Logs Not Showing**: Check permissions on the `/config/logs/` directory inside your container
- **Missing State Data**: State files in `/config/stateful/` track processed items; verify permissions
- **Docker Volume Issues**: Ensure your volume mount for `/config` has correct permissions and ownership
- **Command Timeouts**: Default values are now command_wait_delay=1s and command_wait_attempts=600
- **Debug Information**: Enable Debug Mode temporarily to see detailed API responses in the logs
- **API Timeout Errors**: All apps now use universal timeout settings (120s) from general.json
- **Consistent Log Filtering**: If app-specific logs show mixed content, reduce historical data from 5KB to 1KB
- **Swaparr Issues**: Ensure proper handling of non-dictionary records in queue data
- **App-Specific Problems**: Check GitHub Issues for known problems and solutions
